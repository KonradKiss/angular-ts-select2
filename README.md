==================

`ts-select2` is an angular wrapper directive for [Select2](https://select2.github.io/)

It is still in a very early state so don't judge it to harshly if something doesn't work as expected, but please create an issue for every problem you encounter.

Current state tested with angular versions 1.2.15, 1.2.28 and 1.3.15
